# Shortest-path finding simulation in a map with topographical features

## Motivation

This is a self-paced project aimed at familiarizing  myself with programming in C++ in an object-oriented fashion. Addtionally, I wanted an avenue to experiment with shortest-path finding algorithms in a sandbox enviroment of my own creation, to better understand how graph data structures are used in path-finding.

## Dependencies

This simulation uses the OpenCV library (4.5.5_2) to display the grid with topographical features and a player/vehicle/person within it. The `cmath` library is also used to calculate square-roots and exponents. The remaining dependencies ( i.e. stack, vector, queue, ... ) used in the simulation are part of the C++ standard library. The version of C++ used is C++11 and the compiler version is GCC 4.2.1.

## Running the code
With the dependencies in place, ensure that all `.h` and `.cpp` are in the same directory. In the terminal, ( Was using the terminal on a late 2013 MacBookPro ) enter the command 
```
test
```
