# Shortest-path finding simulation in a map with topographical features

## Motivation

This is a self-paced project aimed to allow me to familiarize myself with programming in C++ in an object-oriented manner. Addtionally, I wanted an avenue to implement shortest-path finding algorithms in a sandbox enviroment of my own creation, to better understand how graph data structures are used in path-finding.
